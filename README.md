## Intended for Gus:

#### For Lab 2
- Compile every .java extension on Lab2/webapps/banking/WEB-INF/classes/ by using `javac -classpath /mnt/c/Users/YOUR_PATH_GOES_HERE/Lab2/lib/servlet-api.jar *.java`

- To start up the server, go to Lab2/bin and type in ```./startup.sh```


- If you modify any Java code on Lab2/webapps/banking/WEB-INF/classes/, make sure to re-compile them. Additionally, you must shut the server down & start it up again when your code has changed by using ``./shutdown.sh && ./startup.sh`` in Lab2/bin
