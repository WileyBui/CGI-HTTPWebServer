### Set-up
1. Clone the repository: `https://github.com/WileyBui/INET4021Labs.git`
2. Create your own branch: `git checkout -b CHANGEYOURBRANCHNAMEHERE`
    - The purpose of this is to work and test on __*your own code/branch*__ as well as not to have too many conflicts when you're pushing the code when working with multiple people.
    - Push your code to GitHub like before: `git add . && git commit "YOURMESSAGEHERE" && git push`
3. If everything works correctly, we can update & push it to the master branch for anyone to use.
    - `git checkout master`
    - `git merge CHANGEYOURBRANCHNAMEHERE`
    - `git push`
    - Notice, merge conflicts may arise when 2 people are working on the same file.
4. The master branch should always have the latest working version

- To see which branch you're on, type `git branch`
- If you're on the master branch, continue to work on your branch by switching it from the master branch to your branch
    - `git checkout CHANGEYOURBRANCHNAMEHERE`
- If you want to see other branches or see if your code has pushed through your branch, click the `Branch: master` button to see the list of branches.
